## How to play

* Go to https://ivo-.github.io/open-haxball/
* Give your friend your ID, so he can connect to you
* Choose a team for every player by hovering over player color box
* Start the game

Once someone scores 5 goals, the game will be stopped. To play another one, just click start again.

You will most probably experiance various glitches. Physics is noticably different.
